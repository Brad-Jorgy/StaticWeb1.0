          BIKE MAGIZINE REVIEW::::
          It's only been a tad more than three years since Yeti introduced its ‘Switch Technology’ suspension platform on its ‘SB’ (Super Bike) line of
           full-suspension rigs, drawing accolades from longtime Yeti lovers while also converting new members to the tribe. We at Bike were early advocates
           of the company’s flagship Switch Technology bike–the 6-inch-travel, 26-inch-wheeled SB-66–and we reveled in the countless hours of trail time spent
           aboard that capable all-rounder. And when Yeti rolled out its 29-inch-wheeled version of that bike, the SB-95, we scrambled to get our hands on one
            and immediately began comparing and contrasting how it performed vis-à-vis its 26-inch sibling. Most of us were sold on the versatile suspension
            design, and one of us even bought a carbon SB-66 as his personal bike.
